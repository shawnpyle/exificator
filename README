Run this script from the command line in the folder with the images you want to 
add exif data to. It will try to find all images in this and all subdirectories.

Or, call with paths to files.

> /some/path/to/exificator.rb file1.jpg file2.jpeg file3.tif

Or, call with glob paths to files

> /some/path/to/exificator.rb /my/path/to/images/*.jp*
